## Prerequisites

To access the datasets, help pages, and functions that we will use in this *help yourself*, load the following packages:

```{r prerequisites}
here::i_am("labs/06_within-subjects-anova/help-yourself_assignment-5.Rmd")

library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(afex)
library(effectsize)
library(emmeans)
library(ggpubr)

source(here("R", "apa_legend.R"))
```

As well as this Help Yourself's example data:

```{r example-data}
# Note here that we specify the column types using the col_types argument
scores <- readr::read_csv(
  here::here("data", "help-yourself_a5.csv"),
  col_types = "fffd"
)
```

## Higher Order ANOVA

Higher order ANOVA uses the `aov_car()` function we learned about last week. The formula syntax is similar to a two-way ANOVA, except we also add an error term to our model for any within-subject variables. The same logic applies to a within-subjects ANOVA, except you would not have an interaction term.


```{r higher-order}
scores_model <- afex::aov_car(
  score ~ task * level + Error(id/(task*level)),
  type = 3,
  data = scores
)

scores_model
```
# UPDATE TO INFORMATION ABOVE (2022)

We can also use the `nice()` function to obtain a summary of the the ANOVA table. In doing so, we can specify the correction method we want to use. `aov_car()` currently does not permit lower bound corrections. We can also use the argument es = to specify generalized ("ges") vs partial eta-squared ("pes"; recommended). 

When using the HF correction, you may notice that R provides the following warning message: "Warning: HF eps > 1 treated as 1". The values of the epsilons cannot exceed 1. Therefore, you should report these values without a 0 before the decimal. Note that the epsilon symbol is a greek alphabet, so no italicizing is needed.

Also, make sure to specify the type of epsilon in your results.

```{r nice function}
nice(scores_model)

#Greenhouse-Geiser
nice(scores_model,correction="GG",es="pes")

#Huynh-Feldt
nice(scores_model,correction ="HF",es="pes")

#None
nice(scores_model,correction ="none",es="pes")
```



We can run our assumption tests and get other information about the model using the `summary()` function. Just a side note, we have been using the `tidy()` function to clean up our models into nice output up until now, but you can use the `summary()` function in place of `tidy()` in most places.

```{r summary}
summary(scores_model)
```

Other than that, the rest of the familiar code for effect size and contrasts will work as usual here.

## Effect sizes for within-subjects contrasts

To get standardized effect sizes for contrasts you can calculate them by hand, create your own function to calculate them, or in some cases use a pre-existing R function. We haven't discussed this yet, but there are actually several different versions of Cohen's d, each with its own (intended) purpose and formula. So when you're reporting Cohen's d you should be aware of the formula you're using, and report the appropriate subscript so people know what denominator you're using to standardize the mean differences. If you're using your own formula in the denominator you should report the full equation somewhere in your report. This recommendation also applies retroactively to any of the previous situations you've reported Cohen's d. See *Cohen (1988), Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences* and the *Learning More* section for more info.

The three versions we'll show below might be useful for within-subjects designs, depending on your reasons for calculating a standardized effect size. A note on these, taken from [Lakens](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00863):

> When the standard deviations of both groups of observations are equal, Cohen's dav, and Cohen's drm are identical, and the effect size equals Cohen's ds (see article) for the same means and standard deviations in a between subject design. In general, Cohen's dav will be more similar to Cohen's ds (compared to Cohen's drm), except when correlations between measures are low, and the difference between the standard deviations is large. Cohen's drm is always more conservative, but with high correlations between observations, sometimes unreasonably conservative. When r is larger than 0.5, Cohen's dz will be larger than Cohen's drm and Cohen's dav, and when r is smaller than 0.5, Cohen's dz will be smaller than Cohen's drm and Cohen's dav. There are situations where reporting Cohen's dz is defensible (see article), but Lakens' general recommendation is to report Cohen's drm or Cohen's dav.

### Cohen's dz

The formula for Cohen's dz is:

$$
\textrm{Cohen′s } d_z = \frac{t}{\sqrt{n}}
                      
$$

You can get an *approximation* of this effect size using the `t_to_d()` function from the **effectsize** package, assuming you have two equal group sizes for your contrast. This uses the test statistic and residual degrees of freedom to get an approximate effect size. You already know how to do contrasts so we're just showing you how the function works below.

```{r t-to-d}
effectsize::t_to_d(t = 2.5, df_error = 9, paired = TRUE)
```

And here's an example showing how to use it with the `mutate()` function. This could be useful if you tidy your emmeans contrasts into a data frame.

```{r t-to-d-mutate}
# A minimal example of some pretend contrast results
pretend_contrast_results <- tibble::tibble(statistic = 2.5, df = 9)

# Then we can just refer to the relevant columns to calculate the effect size
dplyr::mutate(
  pretend_contrast_results,
  effectsize::t_to_d(t = statistic, df_error = df, paired = TRUE)
)
```

Alternatively, you could use the `eff_size()` function from the **emmeans** package to calculate the exact effect size (and get all the nice extras like confidence intervals). All you would do is specify the the value of the denominator (in this case the square root of the sample size) in the `sigma` argument. All the `sigma` argument does is tell the function the value of the denominator to standardize the mean difference on, so this could be applied to any of the other Cohen's d formulas below as well. The only mild annoyance here is that you will have to call the `eff_size()` function multiple times, once for each contrast you need to give a unique value of `sigma` for.

### Cohen's drm

Alternatively, you can calculate Cohen's drm, which accounts for the correlation between your repeated measures.

$$
\textrm{Cohen′s } d_{rm} = \frac{ | M_1 - M2 |}{\sqrt{s^2_1 + s^2_2 - (2 r s_1 s_2)}} \times
                          \sqrt{2(1 - r)}
$$

Where $r$ is the correlation between the two groups you're comparing.

The `cohen.d` function from the **effsize** package (*not the effectsize package!*) can calculate this (and other variations of Cohen's d), as can the `eff_size()` function approach mentioned above (although here you would need to multiply the result by the second standardizer as well). We'll leave you to decide whether to use this or not, and figure it out on your own. You can always verify the results by calculating by hand! 

### Cohen's dav

Finally, you could use the average standard deviation of both your repeated measures (ignoring the correlation between them).

$$
\textrm{Cohen′s } d_{av} = \frac{
                             M_{\text{diff}}
                           }{
                             \frac{s_1 + s_2}{2}
                           }
$$

## Plotting emmeans

For within-subjects designs you want to plot the confidence intervals given by emmeans, rather than the defaults ggpubr gives. To do this you have to use the `geom_errorbar()` function from the **ggplot2** package. We've abstracted how ggplot2 works from you since we have been using ggpubr for plotting, but if you look back to early Help Yourselfs some of the learning more sections link to ggplot2 resources.

```{r plot-emmeans}
scores_model_emm <- emmeans::emmeans(scores_model, specs = "task", by = "level")
scores_model_emmeans <- broom::tidy(scores_model_emm, conf.int = TRUE)
scores_model_emm

ggpubr::ggline(
  scores_model_emmeans,
  x = "level",
  y = "estimate",
  color = "task",
  palette = "grey"
) +
  ggplot2::geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high, color = task),
    width = 0.4
  ) +
  # Reminder, this is a custom function you have to source. See Help Yourself
  # Assignment 1 if you forget how to do that.
  source(here("R"),"apa_legend.R")
  apa_legend(position = "right")
```


## Trend Analysis

There isn't much new here from what you've been doing already, so we're just going to show you the code beginning to end.

```{r trend-analysis}
# First fit your ANOVA model, as usual
scores_model <- afex::aov_car(
  score ~ level + Error(id/(level)),
  type = 3,
  data = scores
)

# Second construct your reference grid, as usual
scores_emm <- emmeans::emmeans(scores_model, specs = "level")

# Third, do your contrasts. Note that we set the method to "poly" here. This is
# how we test for different order trends using polynomial contrasts.
scores_emm_contrast <- emmeans::contrast(
  scores_emm,
  method = "poly",
  infer = TRUE,
  adjust = "none"
)

ggpubr::ggline(scores_emm,x="level",y="estimate",add="mean_ci")
# Fourth, convert t statistics to F statistics, and get the effect size for
# each trend. Note that the numerator degrees of freedom for each contrast
# is 1 when you convert to an F statistic.
scores_emm_contrast <- broom::tidy(scores_emm_contrast)

dplyr::mutate(
  scores_emm_contrast,
  statistic = statistic^2,
  effectsize::F_to_omega2(statistic, df = 1, df_error = df)
)
```
