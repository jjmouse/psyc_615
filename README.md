## Weekly learning

Each week you will learn something new in this lab. All of the learning material in this course is cumulative, so it is important not to skip anything.

### Week 1 (Sep 10)

Please read and work through the [Preface](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/preface.html), [Chapter 1](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/project-1-weighted-dice.html), [Chapter 2](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/basics.html), and [Chapter 3](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/packages.html) of [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/) before next week's lab. Make sure to program along with the book; it will help you learn better and set you up for success for the rest of the course. If you run into problems or have any questions write them down and ask about them in next week's lab.

Optionally, you can also go through Chapters 4 to 7 of the book if you would like. Otherwise you will go through them in the following week.

Also check out the Base R and RStudio cheat sheets! They cover what you learned this week in a condensed manner (plus some extra tips and tricks) and are an excellent reference if you forget something. You can find the cheat sheets at `cheatsheets/base-r.pdf` and `cheatsheets/rstudio-ide.pdf`.
